# World Clock App

Overview: A world clock app for android and IOS devices that was developed using Dart with Google's Flutter framework. Users can select from a list of around 30 different timezones. Selected timezones will be displayed in an organized list, showing their corresponding times and dates. The background of each timezone in the list will automatically rotate between morning, afternoon, and nighttime themes depending on the time in order to help the user quickly identify the general time of day at a glance. The user can choose to display the times for these times in either standard(12-hour) or military(24-hour) format. The user's preferences are saved on the devices internal memory and are loaded each time the app is launched. The app also contains a time conversion tool to assist users in converting time from one timezone to another.

Implements:
- Google Fonts
- Shared Preferences
- Date and Time Pickers
